          <h2>What's the experiment about?</h2>
          <p>
             We will show you a series of words without a particular style and you have to find it hidden in  
             in a bunch of other words in camelCase or kebab-case style. 
             We will measure the time that you require to find such word, in order to undestand
            which of the two style is more readable. 
            <mark class="yellow"> If the task is not clear, don't worry the first two section of the test
              will surely clear all your doubt, and those are not calculated in the test. </mark>
